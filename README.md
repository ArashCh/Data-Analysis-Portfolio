### Sales Analytics for AdventureWorks ([Microsoft's AdventureWorks2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms))
Below is a quick summary:

- **Total Sales Revenue by Product Category Last Year:** I calculated the total revenue for each product category by joining the sales view and product table.
- **Top 5 Customers by Sales Revenue:** I used the Window Function RANK() to find the top customers who contributed the most to overall sales.
- **Top-Selling Product (Revenue & Units Sold):** I identified which product sold the most, in terms of total revenue and units sold separately.
- **Sales Trends Over the Past Year:** I aggregated the sales of each month of the last year and utilized  CTE and Window Function to calculate the SalesGrowth column as well.
- **Regional Sales Performance:** I looked into territories to find out which ones contributed the most to the overall sales.
