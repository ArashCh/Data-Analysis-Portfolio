-- Here I created the view I need for this project
-- Since the sales were in different currencies, I standardized the sales amount by multiplying SalesAmount by AverageRate, considering the currency (obviously) and also the rate of the currency on the date the order occured.
-- I also merged the required columns of the two sales tables (FactInternetSales & FactReselleSales)
